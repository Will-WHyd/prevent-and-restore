                    In a complex world, there are many factors that can make people vunerable to radicalization. 
                    They can apply to anyone, regardless of age, social class, religious, ethnic, or educational background.

                    <p>
                        Sometimes, people face a conflict or crisis concerning their identity. They may question where they feel they belong or fit in.
                        This can make lead to distance between them and their friends, family, and community, and push them to seek out new groups. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There's nothing wrong with making new friends and expanding horizons. But consider - are they cutting themselves off from old friends or family?
                        Are they sharing details or information about new freiends they're involved with?

                        Most people suffering from mental health issues, such as depression, anxiety, PTSD, or others are not drawn to extremism.
                        However, those who are struggling in this way can be targeted and influenced by extremists, 
                        who wish to capitalize on their mental health issues and exploit any emotional vunerabilities.

                    <p>
                        If someone's life isn't going the way they expected it to, they can look to blame their circumstances on other people, events, or groups. 
                        They might feel a sense of injustice about their situation and envy those they percieve to be ahead in life.

                        Is the person you are concerned about feeling angry about how others view them? 
                        Do they feel like an outcast, isolated from society? Do they seem critical or intolerant of other people or groups?
                        Have they remained rigid in their views when you've held conversations about this?

                        Radicalizers are persuasive and have a dominating effect on young and vunerable people,

                        Do they seem rigid and intolerant of people who don't share their views?

                    <summary>5 Excessive time online, sharing extreme views on social media</summary>
                    <p>
                        Radicalizing groups increasingly operate online as influencers, targeting vunerable people via gaming and social media platforms.
                        At first, they will use inoffensive and innocuous posts and sites, such as sharing pet photos or talking about hobbies.
                        Then, they will invite the vunerable people interacting with them to a 'closed' group where extremist views are shared.
                        This creates a sense of community - a vunerable person thrives being made feel special through their membership to the closed group.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is especially prevalant in video gaming communities, where high profile streamers are rewarded by extremists for expressing these views,
                        and extremists establish communities on messaging platforms like Discord to moderate and control large numbers of fans seeking to interact with the streamer and community. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Exposure to online propoganda in this way can increase the desire for vunerable people to become involved in potentially dangerous situations.
                        This can be exploited by radicalisers who seek to recruit suseptible people.
